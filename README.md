# ferrOS


A barebones OS made with Rust, and the help of OSTEP

This project was to get more into the world of bare metal programming. I aim to learn more about Operating Systems, Rust and generally building efficient and responsive applications.

### Project Capstone

I want to be able to play the original Doom on my operating system. This will teach me how to build an emulator as well, which I will most likely do in C++ (following the tutorials on cplusplus) or Rust if this becomes my daily driver.

For now I want to just finish the tutorial and build all the steps detailed in OSTEP, after that I will look elsewhere.

ETA: December 2022
